# phylogen-Y: using the Y-chromosome for deep-time phylogenetics

## Description

In this repository, you will find all of the code that I used to generate and analyze data for the manuscript, "The Y-chromosome is a reliable marker for deep-time phylogenetic inference."

The repository is sorted into multiple folders, and each folder is named after a main method in the paper. Every folder contains a README and houses the scripts used for that section:
* de novo sex-linked sequence identification
* alignment generation
* measuring evolutionary conservation of sites
* assessing variation in substitution rates between sex chromosomes
* identifying gene conversion events

## Getting Started
Each folder has a README file that breaks down its contents, the purpose of the scripts, and how they function.

### Dependencies
The majority of these scripts use basic python packages (argparse, os) and R packages. Most scripts do not require any special dependencies or a walkthrough on how to install necessary packages. 

All code was written ran on a personal MacOS Sonomoa or the [Texas A&M HPRC cluster](https://hprc.tamu.edu).

## Authors
Scripts were primarily written by me, with some debugging and edits provided by Chat-GPT.

If you need assistance with navigating this repository, using any of these scripts, or just general questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via [email](emmarie.alexander@tamu.edu) or create an issue.
