# phylogen-Y: using the Y-chromosome for deep-time phylogenetics

This repistory houses almost all of the code I used to generate and analyze data for the manuscript, "The Y-chromosome is a reliable marker for deep-time phylogenetic inference."

### Getting started
Each folder contains a README that states the purpose of the script(s). The repository itself is sorted into multiple folders, with each folder named after a method section in the paper:
* data collection
* sex-linked sequence identification
* alignments
* measuring evolutionary conservation of sites
* distribution of phylogenomic signal
* alternative topology testing
* identifying gene conversion events

### Dependencies
The majority of these scripts use basic Python packages (argparse, os) and R packages. Most scripts do not require any special dependencies or walkthroughs on how to install necessary packages. I do not provide Conda environment files for most scripts, but dependencies are clearly listed at the start of the code.

All code was written ran on a personal MacOS Sonomoa or the [Texas A&M HPRC cluster](https://hprc.tamu.edu).

### Citation
