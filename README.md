# phylogen-Y: using the Y-chromosome for phylogenetics

## Description

In this repository, you can find many of the scripts that were used for data generation and analysis of the manuscript "Using the mammalian Y-chromosome for deep-time phylogenetic inference."

The repository is sorted into multiple folders, where each folder is named after a method outlined in the paper. These folders house the code and scripts for that methods section:
* data collection
* de novo sex-linked sequence identification
* alignment generation
* detection of rare genomic changes
* measuring evolutionary conservation of sites
* substitution rate analysis
* gene conversion

## Getting Started
Each directory has a README file that breaks down scripts, their purpose, and their function.

### Dependencies
The majority of these scripts use basic python and R packages.

Many of them were run on a MacOS Sonoma or [supercomputer](https://hprc.tamu.edu)

## Authors
These scripts were primarily written by me, Emmarie Alexander. Any code that was not written or contributed by me is denoted as such.

If you need assistance with navigating this repository, using any of these scripts, or general questions about methodology, please send me an [email](emmarie.alexander@tamu.edu) or create an issue.

## CITATION
